It stands slightly above 1,000 feet. Even though it's not as tall as the 2,000 plus feet Santa Monica Mountains right off the Malibu Coast in LA County, it's still worth checking out. There are three main ways to get there: this way which starts in Aliso Viejo, the Canyon Acres Trail in Laguna Beach, and another unnamed trail in Laguna Beach."

However, this trail is a ridge trail so if you inadvertently take the wrong trail you would know because you would be declining off the ridge."
